# Family Budget App ‚Äî MVP (Expense Epic)

Minimal Django API for managing expenses as part of a Family Budgeting Tool. The MVP includes two core features and was developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## ‚úÖ MVP Features

| Feature | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|
| Create Expense | `POST /expenses` |
| List Expenses by Month | `GET /expenses/list?month=YYYY-MM` |

Validation:
- `amount` > 0 and numeric
- `category` required

---

## üß™ TDD Evidence

Two full RED ‚Üí GREEN cycles were completed and pushed to the repo:

- **Cycle 1 (Create Expense)**  
  - RED: validation test fails  
  - GREEN: POST `/expenses` passes

- **Cycle 2 (List by Month)**  
  - RED: filter test fails  
  - GREEN: GET `/expenses/list?month=` passes

Proof:  
- Branch: `feat/expenses`  
- Pull Request: _Expense MVP ‚Äî TDD (2 Cycles)_  
- `pytest -q` shows all tests passing
